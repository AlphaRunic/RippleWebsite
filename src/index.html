                Ripple is an open-source all-purpose Discord bot built with TypeScript. Ripple’s source code also may serve as a framework to your own Discord bot! See <a href="#using-source">Using Source Code</a> for more info.

            <h4 id="author">Author</h4>
            <p>Ripple was developed by 
                <a href="https://github.com/AlphaRunic">AlphaRunic</a>. Command inspirations and ideas are often outsourced.
            </p>
            <h4 id="why">Why Was Ripple Created?</h4>
            <p>Ripple was created because I felt Discord lacked a consistent all-purpose bot (that's actually all-purpose). Obviously there's no scarcity of all-purpose bots in Discord, but another flawless TypeScript bot just completes the picture.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Ripple is a lightweight, yet command-heavy bot. It has 100+ commands, and growing.</p>
            <div class="nest">
                <h4 id="customization">Customization</h4>
                <p>Ripple has a plethora of commands to help personalize your server to the maximum. These commands include utility to set a custom welcome message, an automatic role to be applied upon a user joining, bot prefix, chat revive, level system, and more!</p>
                <h4 id="quoted-args">Quoted Arguments</h4>
                <p>Ripple supports a system called quoted arguments. This means that if you pass an argument to a command, and that argument is a string, you can surround it in quotation marks to treat space-delimited text as one argument.</p>
                <h4 id="type-coercion">Type Coercion</h4>
                <p>Ripple command arguments have a function called type coercion. The purpose of this function is to coerce an argument (which is originally a string) to a different type. For example, in the command
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        ::urban "pog champ" 5
                    </code>, the value "5" is being used to denote what page Urban Dictionary should search. When you input the number 5 into Discord, it's automatically a string (plain text), but Ripple coerces it's type to a number, because the resultNumber argument is defined as a number in the Urban command.
